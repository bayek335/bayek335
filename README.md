## Hi there, it is me Bayu Pamungkas 

I am a curious person, and I am passionate about web development,  especially the Back End. I also learned the Front End but it is not too deep.

In the other hand, I also like the development of games and,  have an interest in digital art such as animation, with 3d animations I like best
